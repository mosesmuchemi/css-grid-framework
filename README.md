# Project: Design your own Grid-based Framework [Collaborative Project]

Although this was supposed to be a collaborative project, I was given go ahead to do it solo since my partner left Microverse. The project description is to create a simple grid system and use it to clone a website of my choice. The site I decided to clone is NodeJS.org [homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/)

This is the final project of the Main HTML/CSS curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc


* The project was completed using html and css
